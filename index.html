<a name="about-cocos3d" class="anchor" href="#about-cocos3d"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Cocos3D</h2>

<p>Cocos3D is a sophisticated, yet intuitive. and easy-to-use, 3D application development
framework for the iOS, Android, and Mac OSX platforms. With Cocos3D, you can build
sophisticated, dynamic 3D games and applications using Objective-C.</p>

<ul>
<li>Build 3D apps for iOS devices, Android devices, or Mac computers running OSX. The same 3D
content and game logic will run unchanged under iOS, Android, or Mac OSX.</li>
<li>Use OpenGL programmable pipelines for sophisticated GLSL shader rendering, or use OpenGL 
fixed pipelines for simpler configurable rendering.</li>
<li>Supports OpenGL ES 2.0 or OpenGL ES 1.1 on iOS and Android devices, and OpenGL on Mac OSX.</li>
<li>Seamless integration with Cocos2D. Rendering of all 3D model objects occurs within a special 
Cocos2D layer, which fits seamlessly into the Cocos2D node hierarchy, allowing 2D nodes such 
as controls, labels, and health bars to be drawn under, over, or beside 3D model objects. 
With this design, 2D objects, 3D objects, and sound can interact with each other to create 
a rich, synchronized audio-visual experience.</li>
<li>Seamless integration with the iOS UIViewController framework.</li>
<li>Pluggable loading framework for 3D models exported from familiar 3D editors such as Blender, 
3ds Max or Cheetah3D, or through industry standard 3D object files such as Collada or PowerVR POD,
or even from your own customized object file formats.</li>
<li>Loading 3D models, textures and GLSL shaders can be performed on a background thread while the
scene is being displayed, and automatically added to the scene when loading is complete.</li>
<li>3D models can be selected and positioned by touch events and gestures, allowing intuitive user
interaction with the objects in the 3D world.</li>
<li>3D models can include animation sequences, with full or fractional animation, in multiple tracks. 
Animation tracks can be blended together, and cross-fading actions can be used to smoothly 
transition between tracks.</li>
<li>3D model objects can be arranged in sophisticated structural assemblies, allowing child objects
to be moved and oriented relative to their parent structure.</li>
<li>3D models and assemblies can be easily duplicated. Each duplicated model can be independently
controlled, animated, colored, or textured. But fear not, underlying mesh data is shared between
models. You can quickly and easily create swarming hoards to populate your 3D world, without
worrying about device memory limitations.</li>
<li>3D models, cameras, and lighting can be manipulated and animated using familiar Cocos2D Actions,
allowing you to quickly and easily control the dynamics of your 3D world, in a familiar, and
easy-to-use programming paradigm.</li>
<li>3D objects can be covered with dynamic materials and textures to create rich, realistic imagery.</li>
<li>Multi-texturing and bump-mapped textures are available, allowing you to create sophisticated surface effects.</li>
<li>Vertex skinning, also often referred to as bone rigging, allowing soft-body meshes to be 
realistically deformed based on the movement of an underlying skeleton constructed of bones and joints.</li>
<li>Automatic shadowing of models using shadow volumes.</li>
<li>Collision detection between nodes.</li>
<li>Ray-casting for nodes intersected by a ray, and the local location of intersection on a node
or mesh, right down to the exact mesh intersection location and face.</li>
<li>The 3D camera supports both perspective and orthographic projection options.</li>
<li>Objects can dynamically track other objects as they move around the world. The 3D camera 
can dynamically point towards an object as it moves, and other objects can dynamically point
towards the camera as it moves.</li>
<li>Lighting effects include multiple lights, attenuation with distance, spotlights, and fog effects.</li>
<li>Mesh data can be shared between 3D objects, thereby saving precious device memory.</li>
<li>Mesh data can freely, and automatically, use OpenGL vertex buffer objects to improve performance
and memory management.</li>
<li>Culling of 3D objects outside of the camera frustum is automatic, based on pluggable, 
customizable object bounding volumes.</li>
<li>Automatic ordering and grouping of 3D objects minimizes OpenGL state changes and improves
rendering performance. Pluggable sorters allow easy customization of object sorting, ordering,
and grouping for optimal application performance.</li>
<li>Rendering to texture for dynamic textures within a scene, or to create sophisticated post-processing effects.</li>
<li>Automatic rendering of the scene to an environment map texture, to create automatic environment
reflections and refractions.</li>
<li>Integrated particle systems:

<ul>
<li>3D point particles provide efficient but sophisticated particle effects.</li>
<li>3D mesh particles allow particles to be created from any 3D mesh template (eg- spheres,
cones, boxes, POD models, etc).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Automatic OpenGL state machine shadowing means that the OpenGL functions are invoked only when a
state really has changed, thereby reducing OpenGL engine calls, and increasing OpenGL throughput.</li>
<li>Sophisticated performance metrics API and tools collect real-time application drawing and updating
performance statistics, for logging or real-time display.</li>
<li>Sophisticated math library eliminates the need to use OpenGL ES function calls for matrix mathematics.</li>
<li>Fully documented API written entirely in familiar Objective-C. No need to switch to C or C++ to work with 3D artifacts.</li>
<li>Extensive logging framework to trace program execution, including all OpenGL ES function calls.</li>
<li>Includes demo applications and Xcode templates to get you up and running quickly.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a name="installation" class="anchor" href="#installation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation</h2>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The Cocos3D framework works with <a href="http://www.cocos2d-swift.org">Cocos2D</a>. Before installing
Cocos3D, you must <a href="http://www.cocos2d-swift.org/download">download</a> and install Cocos2D.<br></p>

<p>The same Cocos3D distribution can be used with <code>Cocos2D 3.x</code>, <code>Cocos2D 2.1</code> or <code>Cocos2D 1.1</code>.
Link to <code>Cocos2D 3.x</code> or <code>Cocos2D 2.1</code> to make use of the more advanced shader-based 
programmable-pipeline available with OpenGL ES 2.0 (iOS) or OpenGL (OSX). Or link to 
<code>Cocos2D 1.1</code> to use the simpler configurable fixed-pipeline of OpenGL ES 1.1 (iOS), 
and avoid the need to write GLSL shaders.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Download the <a href="https://github.com/cocos3d/cocos3d/releases">latest Cocos3D release</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Unzip the Cocos3D distribution file.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Open a Terminal session, navigate to the unzipped Cocos3D distribution directory, and run 
the <code>install-cocos3d</code> script as follows:</p>

<pre><code>./install-cocos3d.sh -2 path-to-cocos2d
</code></pre>

<p>A Cocos2D distribution must be installed. With the -2 option, you specify the version
of Cocos2D to which the Cocos3D demo apps and starter projects should be linked.</p>

<p>As the name implies, the <strong><em>path-to-cocos2d</em></strong> parameter is the path to the Cocos2D
distribution that was downloaded into the specified folder. You may use either a 
relative path, or an absolute path. If for some reason the relative path 
cannot be correctly resolved on your system, or the resulting links to the Cocos2D 
library are not accurate, try again using the full absolute path. An example of using
a relative path is:</p>

<pre><code>./install-cocos3d.sh -2 "../cocos2d-swift-3.2.1"
</code></pre>

<p>When using Cocos2D 3.1 or earlier, you also have the option of setting <strong><em>path-to-cocos2d</em></strong>
to one of (<code>v3</code>, <code>v2</code>, or <code>v1</code>), which will link the Cocos3D demo apps to the Cocos2D Xcode
template libraries that were most recently installed. When using this format, you must have 
previously installed the corresponding version of Cocos2D. <strong>This option is not available with 
Cocos2D 3.2 and later because, as of Cocos2D 3.2, Xcode template projects are no longer available.</strong></p>

<p>If you encounter errors during installation, it's typically because you are trying
to run the installer without first navigating to the Cocos3D distribution directory.
Be sure to run the installer from the Cocos3D distribution directory.</p>
</li>
<li><p>That's it!</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Keep in mind that Cocos3D does not "patch" your Cocos2D installation. Instead, you install
Cocos3D alongside Cocos2D, and link to it using the installation script.</p>

<h2>
<a name="your-first-cocos3d-project" class="anchor" href="#your-first-cocos3d-project"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Your First Cocos3D Project</h2>

<p>The Cocos3D distribution includes a starter app Xcode project that you can use as a starting 
point for developing your own app. Copy the <code>Projects/CC3HelloWorld</code> folder from the Cocos3D 
distribution folder to the location where you want to develop your application. Once copied, 
you can rename the Xcode project to the name of your own app.</p>

<p>The starter app presents a 3D take on the ubiquitous <strong><em>hello, world</em></strong> application. 
In addition to demonstrating how to load and display a 3D model, this application animates the 
model, and includes simple user interaction by having the 3D object visibly respond to finger touches.</p>

<p>The <code>CC3HelloWorldScene.m</code> file is where all the interesting action happens. To add your own 3D
content, or to change the activty and interactivity of the 3D content, edit the methods in that file.</p>

<p>You can also edit the <code>application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:</code> method in the <code>AppDelegate.m</code> 
file to tweak the basic setup of your Cocos3D application. This method is where the Cocos3D 
framework is hooked into the Cocos2D framework, and Apple's OpenGL ES framework.</p>

<p>NOTE: The <code>hello-world.pod</code> 3D model data file used for the <strong><em>hello, world</em></strong> message model
is fairly large, because converting a font to a mesh results in a LOT of triangles.
When adapting this template project for your own application, don't forget to remove the
'hello-world.pod' from the Resources folder of your project!</p>

<p>To learn more about Cocos3D, please refer to the <a href="http://brenwill.com/2011/cocos3d-programming-guide/">Cocos3D Programming Guide</a>
and the latest <a href="http://brenwill.com/docs/cocos3d/2.0.1/api/">API documentation</a>.</p>

<p>You can create a local copy of the API documentation using <code>Doxygen</code> to extract the documentation
from the source files. There is a <code>Doxygen</code> configuration file to output the API documents in the
same format as appears online in the folder Docs/API within the Cocos3D distribution.</p>

<p>The best way to understand what Cocos3D can do is to look at the examples and code in the demo
applications that are included in the Cocos3D distribution, as described in the <a href="#demos">next section</a>.</p>

<h2>
<a name="demo-applications" class="anchor" href="#demo-applications"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Demo Applications</h2>

<p>The best way to understand what Cocos3D can do is to look at the examples and code in the demo
applications that are included in the Cocos3D distribution. These demos, particularly the 
<code>CC3HelloWorld</code> and <code>CC3DemoMashUp</code> apps, will help you understand how to use Cocos3D, and 
demonstrate many of the key features and capabilities of Cocos3D.</p>

<p>For convenience, to access all of the demos together, open either the <code>cocos3d-iOS.xcworkspace</code>
or <code>cocos3d-OSX.xcworkspace</code> Xcode workspace. You can also open each demo project individually
in the Projects folder.</p>

<p>At the time of this release, the current version of Cocos2D is <code>3.2.1</code>, and by default, the demo
apps within the Cocos3D distribution are pre-configured to use that version. To build and run
the demo apps with a different version of Cocos2D, follow the steps described below in the 
section titled <a href="#cocos2dversions">Cocos2D Version Compatibility</a>.</p>

<p>The following demo apps are included in the Cocos3D distribution:</p>

<p><a name="cc3helloworld"></a></p>

<h3>
<a name="cc3helloworld" class="anchor" href="#cc3helloworld"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>CC3HelloWorld</h3>

<p>This basic, easy-to-understand, starter app presents a 3D take on the ubiquitous <strong><em>hello, world</em></strong>
application. In addition to demonstrating how to load and display a 3D model, this application

<h3>
<a name="cc3demo3dtiles" class="anchor" href="#cc3demo3dtiles"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>CC3Demo3DTiles</h3>

<p>A simple demo that lays out multiple small Cocos3D scenes as layers in a larger controllable
Cocos2D layer. The effect is a grid of tiles, with each tile displaying a separate 3D scene,
each containing its own camera and lighting. The main node in each 3D tile can be rotated
under touch control.</p>

<p>This demonstrates the ability to simply include 3D objects in an otherwise 2D game, and 
techniques for optimizing under those conditions. It also demonstrates touch control when
many 3D scene are visible concurrently.</p>

<p><a name="cc3performance"></a></p>

<h3>
<a name="cc3performance" class="anchor" href="#cc3performance"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>CC3Performance</h3>

<p>This is a simple demo of the performance characteristics of Cocos3D. It demonstrates how to
collect detailed statistics about your application's performance. In doing so, it presents
a number of models, and, through the user interface, allows you to control the type of model
loaded, and how many copies to render.</p>

<p>You can dynamically experiment with how different model types, sizes and quantities affect
the performance of Cocos3D. You can also use this performance demo app to compare performance
across different devices.</p>

<p>This demo app is a sophisticated combination of the three demo apps listed above. It 
demonstrates how to include Cocos3D in a UIView using Xcode Storyboards. Using standard
UIKit controls, you can load any of the Cocos3D demos listed above, then shut down the 
running demo, and load a different Cocos3D demo.</p>

<p>Instead of starting with the <code>CC3HelloWorld</code> starter application project, you can add Cocos3D 
to an existing Cocos2D application (for example <code>MyCocos2DApp</code>), to allow you to add 3D content
to your existing 2D application or game.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The first step is to add the Cocos3D Static Library project as a subproject to your Cocos2D
Xcode project, as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Copy the <code>Projects/CC3StatLib</code> folder from the Cocos3D distribution to the
<code>MyCocos2DApp/MyCocos2DApp/Libraries</code> folder within your Cocos2D app.</p></li>
<li><p>Open your <code>MyCocos2DApp.xcodeproj</code> Xcode project.</p></li>
<li><p>Drag the Cocos3D static library Xcode subproject at

</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, within Xcode, you need to tell your Cocos2D app project how to link to the code

<li>
<p>Select the <em>Build Phases</em> tab of the <code>MyCocos2DApp</code> target</p>

<ol>
<li>Open the <em>Target Dependencies</em> list and add the <code>cocos3d</code> target to the list.</li>
<li>Open the <em>Link Binary with Libraries</em> list, and add the <code>libcocos3d.a</code> library to the list.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the <em>Build Settings</em> tab</p>

<ol>
<li>In the <strong>Header Search Paths</strong> (aka <code>HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS</code>) entry, add an entry to
<code>"$(SRCROOT)/$(PROJECT_NAME)/Libraries/CC3StatLib/cocos3d"</code> (including the double-quote marks),
and mark it as <code>recursive</code>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Other Linker Flags</strong> (aka <code>OTHER_LDFLAGS</code>) entry, add an entry for <code>-lstdc++</code>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cocos3D requires a depth buffer to provide 3D depth realism. You can add a depth buffer 
in your application code in the <code>AppDelegate.m</code> file. For Cocos2D 3.x, in the 
<code>application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:</code> method, add the following line in the 
constructor for the config dictionary passed to the <code>setupCocos2dWithOptions:</code> method:</p>

<pre><code>CCSetupDepthFormat: @GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT16,         // Cocos3D requires a depth buffer
</code></pre>

<p>This will create a basic 16-bit depth buffer, which covers most needs. If you want higher depth
accuracy, you can use @GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT24_OES. And if you will be using shadow volume effects, 
use @GL_DEPTH24_STENCIL8_OES to create a combined depth and stencil buffer.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add your custom <code>CC3Layer</code> and <code>CC3Scene</code> source files (<code>MyCC3Layer.h</code>, <code>MyCC3Layer.m</code>, 
<code>MyCC3Scene.h</code>, and <code>MyCC3Scene.m</code>), and any 3D resources your app requires, to the 
<code>MyCocos2DApp</code> target of your <code>MyCocos2DApp.xcodeproj</code> Xcode project.</p></li>
<li>
<p>You can add a 3D component by adding code similar to the following within one of your 
customized 2D scene layouts (eg - <code>MyCocos2DScene.m</code>):</p>

<pre><code>#import "MyCC3Layer.h"

...

CC3Layer* cc3Layer = [[MyCC3Layer alloc] init];
cc3Layer.contentSize = CGSizeMake(300.0, 200.0);
cc3Layer.position = CGPointMake(100.0, 100.0);
[self addChild: cc3Layer];

<a name="using-cocos3d-with-spritebuilder" class="anchor" href="#using-cocos3d-with-spritebuilder"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Using Cocos3D with SpriteBuilder</h2>

<p>You can use Cocos3D to add 3D content to games created with <a href="http://www.spritebuilder.com">SpriteBuilder</a>.
Adding Cocos3D to SpriteBuilder is similar to adding Cocos3D to an existing Cocos2D app, as described above
in <a href="#cocos2d">Adding Cocos3D to an existing Cocos2D Project</a>. To add Cocos3D your SpriteBuilder project, create your 
SpriteBuilder app (for example <code>MySpriteBuilderApp.spritebuilder</code>) as you normally would, then follow these
instructions to add Cocos3D to it:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>The first step is to add the Cocos3D Static Library project as a subproject to your SpriteBuilder Xcode 
project, as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Copy the <code>Projects/CC3StatLib</code> folder from the Cocos3D distribution to the 
<code>MySpriteBuilderApp.spritebuilder/Source/libs</code> folder within your SpriteBuilder app.</p></li>
<li><p>Open your <code>MySpriteBuilderApp.xcodeproj</code> Xcode project.</p></li>
<li><p>Drag the Cocos3D static library Xcode subproject at 
<code>MySpriteBuilderApp.spritebuilder/Source/libs/CC3StatLib/cocos3d-iOS.xcodeproj</code> to the
<code>libs</code> group in the <em>Project Navigator</em> panel of your <code>MySpriteBuilderApp</code> Xcode project
(if you are building an OSX app, drag the <code>cocos3d-OSX.xcodeproj</code> subproject instead).</p></li>
<li><p>Drag the Cocos3D GLSL shader folder at <code>MySpriteBuilderApp.spritebuilder/Source/libs/CC3StatLib/cocos3d-GLSL</code>
to the <em>Project Navigator</em> panel of your <code>MySpriteBuilderApp</code> Xcode project.
When prompted for the target to add the source code to, select the <code>MySpriteBuilderApp</code> 
target. Once added, these files will appear in the <em>Copy Bundle Resources</em> list on the
<em>Build Phases</em> tab of the <code>MySpriteBuilderApp</code> target.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, within Xcode, you need to tell your SpriteBuilder app project how to link to the code 
and components of the Cocos3D subproject:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Select your <code>MySpriteBuilderApp</code> project in the Xcode <em>Project Navigator</em> panel.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Select the <em>Build Phases</em> tab of the <code>MySpriteBuilderApp</code> target</p>

<ol>
<li>Open the <em>Target Dependencies</em> list and add the <code>cocos3d</code> target to the list.</li>
<li>Open the <em>Link Binary with Libraries</em> list, and add the <code>libcocos3d.a</code> library to the list.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the <em>Build Settings</em> tab</p>

<ol>
<li>In the <strong>Header Search Paths</strong> (aka <code>HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS</code>) entry, add an entry to
<code>"Source/libs/CC3StatLib/cocos3d"</code> (including the double-quote marks), and mark it as <code>recursive</code>.</li>
<li>In the <strong>Other Linker Flags</strong> (aka <code>OTHER_LD_FLAGS</code>) entry, add an entry for <code>-lstdc++</code>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cocos3D requires a depth buffer to provide 3D depth realism. You can add a depth buffer in your
application code in the <code>AppDelegate.m</code> file. In the <code>AppContoller application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:</code>
method, add the following line somewhere <strong><em>before</em></strong> the call to <code>setupCocos2dWithOptions:</code></p>

<pre><code>cocos2dSetup[CCSetupDepthFormat] = @GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT16;        // Cocos3D requires a depth buffer
</code></pre>

<p>This will create a basic 16-bit depth buffer, which covers most needs. If you want higher depth
accuracy, you can use @GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT24_OES. And if you will be using shadow volume effects,
use @GL_DEPTH24_STENCIL8_OES to create a combined depth and stencil buffer.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Add your custom <code>CC3Layer</code> and <code>CC3Scene</code> source files (<code>MyCC3Layer.h</code>, <code>MyCC3Layer.m</code>, 
<code>MyCC3Scene.h</code>, and <code>MyCC3Scene.m</code>), and any 3D resources your app requires, to the 
<code>MySpriteBuilderApp</code> target of your <code>MySpriteBuilderApp.xcodeproj</code> Xcode project.</p></li>
<li>
<p>You're now ready to add 3D content to your SpriteBuilder interface. As with any Cocos3D
application, you provide 3D content by creating a custom subclass of <code>CC3Layer</code>. Open your
<code>MySpriteBuilderApp.spritebuilder</code> project, and add your custom <code>CC3Layer</code> to your SpriteBuilder 
layout as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Drag a <em>Node</em> from the SpriteBuilder component palette to your layout.</li>
<li>Set the <em>Custom class</em> property of the new component to the name of your custom <code>MyCC3Layer</code> class.</li>
<li>Set the <em>Content size</em> property to the size at which you want your want your 3D scene to be displayed.</li>
<li>When first placed, the <code>MyCC3Layer</code> component will be added as a child of the root node of the 
SpriteBuilder scene. If you want the <code>MyCC3Layer</code> node to move as part of another node, you can use 
the SpriteBuilder timeline hierarchy to reposition the node to be a child of a different parent.</li>
<li>
<em>Save</em> and <em>Publish</em> your new SpriteBuilder layout.</li>
<li>Build and run your app from Xcode to see your new 3D content.</li>
<li>Repeat for all 3D sprites that you want to add to your SpriteBuilder scene.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>
<a name="cocos2d-version-compatibility" class="anchor" href="#cocos2d-version-compatibility"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Cocos2D Version Compatibility</h2>

<p>Cocos3D under iOS and Android is compatible with <code>Cocos2D</code> <code>3.x</code> and <code>Cocos2D</code> <code>2.1</code>, for 
using programmable-pipeline OpenGL ES 2.0, and is compatible with <code>Cocos2D</code> <code>1.1</code>, for 
using fixed-pipeline OpenGL ES 1.1.</p>

<p>Cocos3D under OSX is compatible with <code>Cocos2D</code> <code>3.x</code> and <code>Cocos2D</code> <code>2.1</code>, for using
programmable-pipeline OpenGL. Cocos3D is not compatible with <code>Cocos2D</code> <code>1.1</code> under OSX.</p>

<p>At the time of this release, the current version of Cocos2D is <code>3.2.1</code>, and by default, the demo
apps within the Cocos3D distribution are pre-configured to use that version. To build and run
the demo apps with a different version of Cocos2D, follow the steps described here:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Run the <code>install-cocos3d.sh</code> script again and identify the new version of <code>Cocos2D</code> to be linked.
Keep in mind that you must link <code>Cocos2D</code> <code>3.x</code> or <code>Cocos2D 2.1</code> if you want to use OpenGL ES 2.0
(iOS &amp; Android) or OpenGL (OSX) with a programmable rendering pipeline, and you must link
<code>Cocos2D 1.1</code> if you want to use OpenGL ES 1.1 (iOS &amp; Android) with a fixed rendering pipeline.</p></li>
<li><p>In the Xcode <em>Project Navigator</em> panel, delete the reference to the <em>cocos2d</em> group in the
<code>cocos2d-library-iOS</code> or <code>cocos2d-library-OSX</code> project.</p></li>
<li><p>Add the newly linked Cocos2D files to the project by dragging the <code>cocos2d</code> folder from the 
Cocos3D distribution folder into the <code>cocos2d-library-iOS</code> or <code>cocos2d-library-OSX</code> 
project in the Xcode <em>Project Navigator</em> panel. When prompted for the target to add the source
code to, select the <code>cocos2d</code> target.</p></li>
<li><p>In the Xcode <em>Project Navigator</em> panel, delete the reference to the <em>cocos2d-chipmunk</em> group
in the <code>cocos2d-chipmunk-library-iOS</code> or <code>cocos2d-chipmunk-library-OSX</code> project.</p></li>
<li><p>Add the newly linked Cocos2D Chipmunk files to the project by dragging the <code>cocos2d-chipmunk</code>
folder from the Cocos3D distribution folder into the <code>cocos2d-chipmunk-library-iOS</code> or 
<code>cocos2d-chipmunk-library-OSX</code> project in the Xcode <em>Project Navigator</em> panel. When prompted
for the target to add the source code to, select the <code>cocos2d-chipmunk</code> target.</p></li>
<li>
<p>If you are using Cocos2D 3.2 or later, configure the <code>CCNoARC.m</code> file to use Manual Refernce Counting:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Select the <code>cocos2d-library-iOS</code> or <code>cocos2d-library-OSX</code> project.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the <em>Build Phases</em> tab of the <code>cocos2d</code> target.</p></li>
<li><p>Open the <em>Compile Sources</em> list and locate the entry for the <code>CCNoARC.m</code> file.</p></li>
<li><p>On the <code>CCNoARC.m</code> entry, double-click the <em>Compiler Flags</em> column and enter the 
<code>-fno-objc-arc</code> compiler flag. As the name implies, the  <code>CCNoARC.m</code> file uses Manual
Refernce Counting (MRC) instead of Automatic Reference Counting (ARC), to improve performance.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Cocos2D</code> <code>3.x</code> uses Automatic Reference Counting (ARC). <code>Cocos2D</code> <code>2.1</code> and <code>Cocos2D</code> <code>1.1</code>
do not. You must set the appropriate compiler build setting to ensure the compiler will use
the correct technique.</p>

<ol>
<li>In the <code>cocos2d-library-iOS</code> or <code>cocos2d-library-OSX</code> project, select the <code>cocos2d</code> 
target in your project settings.</li>
<li>Select the <em>Build Settings</em> tab.</li>
<li>Locate the <strong>Objective-C Automatic Reference Counting</strong> (aka <code>CLANG_ENABLE_OBJC_ARC</code>)
setting for the <code>cocos2d</code> target. If you are now linking to <code>Cocos2D</code> <code>3.x</code>, set this
property to <code>YES</code>. If you are now linking to <code>Cocos2D</code> <code>2.1</code> or <code>Cocos2D</code> <code>1.1</code>, set 
this property to NO. Make sure you change only the setting for the <code>cocos2d</code> target 
within your project. Do not change the setting for the <code>cocos2d-library-iOS</code> or 
<code>cocos2d-library-OSX</code> project itself.</li>
<li>The <code>cocos2d-chipmunk</code> part of the <code>Cocos2D</code> <code>3.x</code> library does <em>not</em> use ARC. Ensure
the <strong>Objective-C Automatic Reference Counting</strong> (aka <code>CLANG_ENABLE_OBJC_ARC</code>) setting
of the <code>cocos2d-chipmunk</code> target is always set to NO.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<code>Cocos2D</code> <code>3.x</code> supports compiling to the ARM64 architecture. <code>Cocos2D</code> <code>2.1</code> and
<code>Cocos2D</code> <code>1.1</code> do <em>not</em> support compiling to the ARM64 architecture. Because of this,
by default, the <strong>Valid Architectures</strong> (aka <code>VALID_ARCHS</code>) build setting for all demo 
Xcode Projects in the Cocos3D distribution is set to <code>$(ARCHS_STANDARD_32_BIT)</code> (which 
resolves to <strong>armv7 armv7s</strong>), so that the demo projects will compile with all versions
of <code>Cocos2D</code>. If you are now linking to <code>Cocos2D</code> <code>3.x</code>, you can set this property to
<code>$(ARCHS_STANDARD)</code> (or simply remove this setting from the Project), in all demo Projects,
to allow compilation to include the ARM64 architecture.</li>
<li>As a development optimization, if you are now linking to <code>Cocos2D</code> <code>3.x</code>, you can set the 
value of the <strong>Build Active Architecture Only</strong> (aka <code>ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH</code>) build setting in 
the <em>Debug</em> configuration in all demo projects to <code>YES</code>. You should not do this if you are
linking to <code>Cocos2D</code> <code>2.1</code> or <code>Cocos2D</code> <code>1.1</code>, as this will prohibit you from building
the demo apps on devices that use the ARM64 processor.</li>
<li>If you have already built the demo app using the old version of <code>Cocos2D</code>, delete the 
contents of your <code>~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData</code> folder before attempting to compile again.</li>

<p>Cocos3D (along with Cocos2D) is written in Objective-C. Cocos3D has partnered with 
<a href="http://www.apportable.com">Apportable</a> to bring your 3D apps and games to the Android
platform. The Apportable SDK is a free SDK for porting Objective-C applications to Android.</p>

<p>To build and install your app or game project for the Android platform:</p>

<ol>
<li>Download and install the Apportable SDK.</li>
<li>Open a <code>Terminal</code> window and navigate to the Xcode project folder of your Cocos3D app.</li>
<li>Run the command: <code>apportable install</code> to build and install your Cocos3D app on an
Android device connected to your computer.</li>
</ol>

<p>Please refer to the Apportable SDK documentation for more information about building,
installing, and debugging your app on Android. If you are building an OpenGL ES 1.1 app, 
you will need to modify the <code>configuration.json</code> file in your Xcode project, as indicated
in that file.</p>

<h2>
<a name="creating-pod-3d-model-files" class="anchor" href="#creating-pod-3d-model-files"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Creating POD 3D Model Files</h2>

<p>Cocos3D reads 3D model content from POD files.</p>

<p>If you are using <em>Blender</em>, <em>Maya</em>, or <em>3DS Max</em> as your 3D editor, you can install the <em>PVRGeoPOD</em>
plugin from Imagination Technologies to export directly from your editor to the POD file format.</p>

<p>For other editors, you can export your 3D model to a file in <code>COLLADA 1.4</code> format, and then use
the standalone <em>PVRGeoPOD</em> app to convert the COLLADA file to the POD format.</p>

<p>Both the standalone and plugin versions of <em>PVRGeoPOD</em> are available free of charge from
Imagination Technologies, the supplier of the GPU's used in iOS devices.</p>

<p>Read the <a href="http://brenwill.com/2011/cocos3d-importing-converting-collada-to-pod/">full instructions</a>
for more info on where to get the <em>PVRGeoPOD</em> converter, and how to use it to generate POD files.</p>

<p>If you are using <em>Blender</em> as your 3D editor, and have many <code>.blend</code> files to export to POD format,
you can use the command-line batch tool available in the <code>Tools/Blender-POD Batch Converter</code>
folder in the Cocos3D distribution. See the <code>README.txt</code> file in that folder for instructions.
The <code>Blender-POD Batch Converter</code> tool was created by Cocos3D user Nikita Medvedev.</p>

<h2>
<a name="demo-models" class="anchor" href="#demo-models"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Demo Models</h2>

<p>Some of the POD models that appear in the demo and template apps were designed in Blender and
exported to POD files using the PowerVR <em>PVRGeoPOD</em> converter.</p>

<p>As a reference for the creation of your own 3D models for use in Cocos3D, you can find the original
<em>Blender</em> files for these POD models in the <code>Models</code> folder in the Cocos3D distribution.</p>
